### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Tsukuba, studying computer science. I also belong to the [MDL](https://www.mdl.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/), where I study fairness in machine learning.


I also work part-time at [AVILEN](https://avilen.co.jp/) Corporation as a machine learning engineer.

Examples of projects you have been responsible for.
- Portrait generation with GAN
- Portrait avatar web conferencing tool development
- Motion estimation from lecture videos and feature extraction as learner FB
- Lightweighting of anomaly detection models and improvement of explainability

I have particular expertise in the field of computer vision, with experience ranging from image classification to image generation and anomaly detection. Recently, I have been working on developing products dealing with natural language processing.
